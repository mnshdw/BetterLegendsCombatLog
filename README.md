**Better Legends Combat Log**

This mod attempts to improve the combat log in a variety of ways.

**What does it do?**

Overall the mod intercepts the text sent to the combat log and tries to rewrite it to be more concise and readable.

Example with default settings:

**Supported options**

There are a few options that allow customizing what is logged:

- Show Morale Changes: Enabled by default. Show morale changes for both allies and enemies, eg. `Arbalester is wavering`.
- Show Misses: Enabled by default. Show skills that miss their target(s).
